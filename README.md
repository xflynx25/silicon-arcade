## Games

| Game | Style | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| **TETHER** | Co-opetition | Spirits linked by an elastic tether — swing, slingshot, collect orbs |
| **POLARITY** | Competitive duel | Magnetic ships flip polarity to grab and shoot a shared charged ball |
| **RICOCHET** | Competitive duel / co-op / pong | Tilt paddles to deflect a neon ball — smash lunge, curve spin, and three selectable modes |
| **ECHO** | Co-op survival | Defend the Core in the dark — ping to reveal husks, strike to destroy them, resonate together |
| **VORTEX** | Sumo knockout | Charge-dash ships in a shrinking arena — knock your opponent out |
| **NOVA** | Orbital duel | Comets orbit a star's gravity — slingshot for speed, ram to shatter your rival |

## Controls

Shared across all games:

- **Player 1:** `W A S D` move, `Left Shift` primary, `Space` secondary
- **Player 2:** `Arrow keys` move, `Right Shift` (or `/`) primary, `Enter` secondary
- **Global:** `Enter` start, `R` restart, hold `H` for the in-game How to Play card

### POLARITY specifics

- The shared core carries a charge — **opposite charges attract, like charges repel**
- Flip your polarity to pull the core toward you, then shove it into the rival's glowing gate
- `Space` / `Enter` **dash** — lunges you and briefly *grabs* the core toward you
- `E` / `.` **burst** — a shockwave that knocks the core and your rival away (cooldown)
- Any time: `[` / `]` adjust **Field Strength** (0.4×–2.5×) to make all forces weaker or stronger

### RICOCHET specifics

- P1: `W/S` slide paddle, `A/D` tilt
- P2: `↑/↓` slide paddle, `←/→` tilt
- On title screen: `1` Duel · `2` Rally · `3` Goals, then `Enter` to start
- **Duel** — competitive; first to 5 wins
- **Rally** — co-op; keep the ball alive together, live rally count + best rally tracked
- **Goals** — competitive pong with discrete goal zones per side (one moving, one blinking); miss the zone and the wall holds

### ECHO specifics

- Co-op survival in the dark — defend the shared **Core** at the center through 6 waves
- **Husks** crawl in from the black and are nearly invisible until revealed
- `Shift` / `RShift` **ping** — a sonar ring that lights up every husk it sweeps (they fade back to dark)
- `Space` / `Enter` **strike** — destroys husks close to you; position using what your pings reveal
- When both players' pings **overlap**, they **resonate** — the arena flashes bright and everything nearby is blasted apart
- Let a husk reach the Core and it takes a bite; drop the Core to zero and the dark wins

### VORTEX specifics

- Hold `Shift` / `RShift` to charge dash, release to lunge
- `Space` / `Enter` parry shield

### NOVA specifics

- The central star's gravity constantly pulls both comets inward — thrust to steer your orbit
- **Dive close** to the star for a gravity-assist speed boost, then use it to ram
- Ramming: the **faster comet shatters the slower one**; near-matched speeds just bounce
- Hold `Shift` / `RShift` to charge a **Flare** burst, release to lunge along your aim
- `Space` / `Enter` **Shield** — a timed parry that reflects a ram and wins the exchange (cooldown)
- Two death lines: burn up in the star's **corona** or drift out past the **void** edge
- Any time: `[` / `]` adjust **Gravity** (0.4×–2.5×); best of 5 rounds
